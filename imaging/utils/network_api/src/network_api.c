    - MISRA.STDLIB.WRONGNAME.UNDERSCORE (#3201, #3202): Reserved names '__i' and '__arr' used in macro expansion
    - MISRA.EXPR.PARENS.2012 (#3203): Operator precedence not made explicit in macro expressions
    - MISRA.STMT.NO_COMPOUND (#3204): Loop body is not a compound statement in macro expansion
    - MISRA.ETYPE.COMP.CAST.EXPL.DIFFERENT.2012 (#3205): Cast from 'unsigned long int' to 'signed' type
