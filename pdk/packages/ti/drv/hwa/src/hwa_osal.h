 *
 *   @brief
 *      This is the sample OS Adaptation layer which is used by the HWA
 *      driver. The OSAL layer can be ported using the following
 *      manner to a native OS:
 *
 *      <b> Approach 1: </b>
 *      @n  Use Prebuilt Libraries
 *           - Ensure that the provide an implementation of all
 *             Osal_XXX API for their native OS.
 *           - Link the prebuilt libraries with their application.
 *           - Refer to the "test" directory for an example of this
 *       @n <b> Pros: </b>
 *           - Customers can reuse prebuilt TI provided libraries
 *       @n <b> Cons: </b>
 *           - Level of indirection in the API to get to the actual OS call
